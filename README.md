A stopwatch web application that is responsive and user friendly. Features:
1) HTML elements to add the timer, buttons and lap-tracking table. The best lap time is also displayed.
2) Using JavaScript, functions were added to start, pause, resume and reset the stopwatch.
3) When the timer is started, the 'Start' button changes functionality as a 'Reset' button.
4) Similarly, when the timer is paused, the 'Pause' button changes into a 'Resume' button.
5) Another JavaScript function is activated when the user clicks on the 'Lap' button, and it determines the lap time.
6) CSS and Bootstrap were used to add the styling.

The main elements are:
 1) The timer itself, displaying time in hr:mins:secs:ms.
 2) Buttons for starting, pausing and recording a lap.
 3) A section for displaying the best (shortest) lap time.
 4) A table displaying all lap times for tracking.
